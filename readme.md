# Implementation Steps

1. Basic Calculator (Main Branch)

	Implement basic arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
	
	Write unit tests for each function.

2. Intermediate Calculator (Part 2)

	Introduce Calculation class (instance methods).
	
	Implement static methods in Calculator class.
	
	Ensure exception handling for division by zero.
	
	Write additional unit tests.

3. Advanced Calculator (Part 3)

	Implement Calculations class (class methods) for history management.
	
	Use @classmethod, @staticmethod, and @property appropriately.
	
	Implement pytest fixtures and parameterized tests.
	
	Achieve 100% test coverage and pylint compliance.

4. Branching Strategy

	Main Branch: Basic Calculator (Functions Only).
	
	Part 2 Branch: OOP with Static Methods & Instance Methods.
	
	Part 3 Branch: Fully Featured Calculator (Class Methods, History, Parameterized Tests).
